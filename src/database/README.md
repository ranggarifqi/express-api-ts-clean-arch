# Database

Database is the most outer layer of Clean Architecture. And considered as frameworks & drivers

"default" is the default connection we use

if you want to add more DB connection that supported by TypeORM, then you can add more folders here.

For example: you want to create Redis Connection, or Mongo, or else.
